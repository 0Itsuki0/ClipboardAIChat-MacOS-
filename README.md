# Clipboard AI Chat (MacOS)

Ask ChatGPT to complete tasks by passing in necessary information using Clipboard (Pasteboard).

Accepted Items type:
- Image
- Text

*Other types such as files or powerpoint slides will be ignored.*


## Motivation
By having the app polling the changes in the clipboard (pasteboard) automatically, we can eaily passing information using Command+C for regular copy, Shift+Control+Command+3, or Shift+Control+Command+4 for screenshots.

This can save us a lot of effort in trying to get together the  information we need AI to perform tasks on!
